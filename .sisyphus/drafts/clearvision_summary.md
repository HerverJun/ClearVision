## Plan Generated: ClearVision Execution Plan

**Key Decisions Made:**
- **Real-time Streaming**: Adopted **CoreWebView2SharedBuffer** (Shared Memory) for zero-copy image transmission. This ensures >30FPS performance for industrial cameras, which Base64 cannot match.
- **Type Safety**: Selected **Source Generators** (TypedSignalR/Incremental) over CLI tools for tighter build integration and instant feedback.
- **Flow Editor**: Decided to **Refine Existing Custom Canvas** rather than rewriting in React Flow, preserving current progress while adding missing features (Drag & Drop, Validation).
- **Serialization**: Standardized on **System.Text.Json** for all engineering files to avoid XML overhead.

**Scope:**
- **IN**: All 6 phases from TODO.md, including CI/CD and Documentation.
- **OUT**: Migration to full SignalR (unless required for remote access), 3D Visualization.

**Guardrails Applied:**
- **Performance**: Strict memory management (MatPool) and Zero-copy streaming.
- **Quality**: TDD enforced for all new Command Handlers.

**Auto-Resolved** (minor gaps fixed):
- **Build Errors**: Phase 1.1 explicitly targets resolving current LSP/Reference errors.
- **Project Structure**: CQRS folder structure defined in Phase 2.1.

**Decisions Needed** (if you disagree with defaults):
- *Default*: Use Shared Memory for images. (Alternative: Base64)
- *Default*: Use Source Generators for TS types. (Alternative: TypeGen CLI)
